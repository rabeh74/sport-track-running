# idea

 keep track of your running plans and log your actual runs.

1- scheduled plans,whether they were completed or skipped,

2- the statistics tracked of actual runs (e.g. distance, duration, pace and average heart rate) and

3-race days and names. It also allows you to indicate whether plans and runs are of easy, tempo, intervals or endurance category, or uncategorised.
